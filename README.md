# FPS_test (prototype of KillBox)

A simple FPS game that will use FreeGLUT and GLFW for the graphics and input, OpenAL for the sound and SDL_net for network play. 
It is distributed under the GNU GPL v2. 

This was only a prototype to test the feasibility of a homemade OpenGL engine for KillBox: https://github.com/AXDOOMER/KillBox
